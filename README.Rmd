## Introduction

> To err is human - Alexander Pope (1711)

`err` is a light-weight R package to produce customizable number and object sensitive error and warning messages.

## Demonstration

### Object Sensitive

The `co` functions produce object sensitive strings.
```{r}
library(err)

fox <- c("The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog")
co(fox)
co(fox[1])
co(fox[0])
co(fox, nlots = 5)
```

### Customizable

The object sensitive strings are fully customized.
```{r}
one <- "darn! the vector %o of length %n has the following value: %c"
none <- "phew! vector %o is empty"
some <- "rats! vector %o has the following %n element%s: %c"
lots <- "really?! the %n elements of vector %o are too numerous to print"

co(fox[0], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
co(fox[1], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
co(fox[1:3], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
co(fox[1:5], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
```

The following `sprintf`-like types can be used in the custom messages:

- `%c`: the object as a comma separated list (producted by a `cc` function)
- `%n`: the length of the object
- `%o`: the name of the object
- `%s`: 's' if n != 1 otherwise ''
- `%r`: 'are' if n != 1 otherwise 'is'

And there are various formatting options
```{r}
co(fox[1:6], conjunction = "or", bracket = "|", oxford = TRUE, ellipsis = 5)
```

### Data Frames

There is also a method for data frames.

```{r}
cat(co(datasets::mtcars, conjunction = "and", oxford = TRUE, ellipsis = 5))
```

### Number Sensitive

The `cn` function produces number sensitive customizable messages

```{r}
cn(0)
cn(1)
cn(2)
cn(100, lots = "there %r %n value%s - this is a lot")
```

### Warning and Error Messages

The `co` and `cn` functions can be combined with the wrappers `msg`, `wrn` and `err` to produce a message, warning and error (without the call as part of the warning/error message).

```{r, error = TRUE}
msg(cn(2))
wrn(cn(2))
err(cn(2))
```
