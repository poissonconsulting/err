## Introduction

`err` is an R package to produce customisable number sensitive error and warning messages.

## Demonstration

### Number Sensitive

The `cn` functions produce number sensitive strings.
```{r}
library(err)

fox <- c("The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog")
cn_and(fox)
cn_and(fox[1])
cn_and(fox[0])
cn_and(fox, ellipsis = 5)
```

### Customisable

The number sensitive strings are fully customised.
```{r}
one <- "darn! the vector %o of length %n has the following value: %c"
none <- "phew! vector %o is empty"
some <- "rats! vector %o has the following %n element%s: %c"
lots <- "really?! the %n elements of vector %o are too numerous to print"

cn_and(fox[0], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
cn_and(fox[1], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
cn_and(fox[1:3], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
cn_and(fox[1:5], one = one, none = none, some = some, lots = lots, nlots = 5)
```

The following `sprintf`-like types can be used in the custom messages:

- `%c`: the object as a comma separated list (producted by a `cc` function)
- `%n`: the length of the object
- `%o`: the name of the object
- `%s`: s if n != 1 otherwise a blank

And there are various formatting options
```{r}
cn_or(fox[1:6], bracket = "|", oxford = TRUE, ellipsis = 5)
```

### Warning and Error Messages

The `cn` functions can be combined with the wrappers `msg`, `wrn` and `err` to produce a message, warning and error (without the call as part of the warning/error message).

```{r, error = TRUE}
msg(cn_and(fox[1]))
wrn(cn_and(fox[1]))
err(cn_and(fox[1]))
```
