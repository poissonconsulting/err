Description: Messages should provide users with grammatically correct information 
    about R objects without flooding their console. 
    'cc()' concatenates vector and data frame values 
    into a gramatically correct string using commas, an ellipsis and conjunction. 
    'cn()' allows the user to define a string which varies based on a count.
    'co()' combines the two to produce a customizable object aware string.
    The package further facilitates this process by providing five sprintf-like 
    types such as '%n' for the length of an object and '%o' for its name as
    well as wrappers for pasting objects and issuing errors, warnings and messages.
